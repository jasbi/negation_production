**1. Introduction** 

Previous research has proposed the following stages for children's production of negation [@klimaBellugi1966; @wode1977four]: 1. one-word negatives like *no*, 2. anaphoric *no* along with other words in responses to a previous utterance (e.g. no, outside) 3. pre-sentential non-anaphoric *no* or *not* (e.g. "no I see truck" to mean "I can't/don't see the truck") 4. *no*/*not* between the subject and the verb (e.g. "Kathrine no like celery"), adding *can't* and *don't* to the set of negators as unanalayzed wholes (e.g. "I can't open it") because *can* and *do* are not produced separately in this stage, 5. adult-like negation. However, stages 3 and 4 have been criticized for not being properly supported by the available data (de Villiers \& de Villiers 1979; Park 1979; Drozd 1995). In addition, Cameron-Faulkner et al. (2007) analyzed productions of a child in their corpus and argued for a "*no*-*not*-*n't* cline": children first produce *no*, followed by *not*, and finally the clitic form *n't*. 

This study uses the largest available child language corpus to bring more data to bear on these hypotheses.

```{r dataImport, include=FALSE}
negation_relfreq <- readRDS("../processed_data/category_table") 
negative_proportions <- readRDS("../processed_data/negation_proportions")
exclusions <- read_csv("../processed_data/exclusions.csv")

negative_proportions$category <- fct_recode(negative_proportions$category, `n't`="auxiliary", adverbial = "adverb", quantificational = "quantifier")

negative_proportions$category <- fct_relevel(negative_proportions$category, "no", "not", "n't")
```

**2. Background**



**3. Study 1** 

**3.1 Methods**

We used the [CHILDES](https://childes.talkbank.org/) corpora (MacWhinney 2000), available via [childes-db](childes-db.stanford.edu) (Sanchez et al. 2019). English-North America and English-UK collections were tokenized. After exclusions due to unintelligibility or missing information (N = `r format(exclusions$Unintelligible + exclusions$missing + exclusions$age_ex, big.mark=",")`), the collection contained `r format(sum(negation_relfreq$count), big.mark=",")` tokens from the speech of `r exclusions$n_children` children. Tokens were classified into positive and negative morphemes, with the following negative morpheme categories: *no*, *not*, auxiliary clitic *n't*, negative pronouns and quantifiers (*none*, *nothing*, *nobody*, *no-one*, *nowhere*), negative adverb of frequency *never*, and derivational negatives with *un-* (e.g. unhappy), *in-* (e.g. invisible), *dis-*(e.g. disappear), *de-* (e.g. defrost), *non-* (e.g. nonsense), and *-less* (e.g. careless).

**3.2 Results** -- Between 12-18 months, almost all negative forms produced by children were instances of *no*, with some contracted auxiliary negatives like *don't* and *can't* (Figure 1). The proportions of *not* and its contracted form *n't* increased rapidly and simultaneously between 18-30 months until around 36-42 months they reached close to parent levels. Children started producing *not* and *n't* around the same time, if not *n't* slightly earlier. They started producing the positive auxiliaries such as *do* and *can* around the same time as negative ones (Figure 2). Compatible with Drozd's (1995) similar corpus findings, only a very small percentage of children's negative utterances could be analyzed as pre-sentential non-anaphoric negation.

```

```

**4. Study 2**

**4.1 Methods**

**4.2 Results**

**5. Conclusions** -- Results supported early productions of *no* (stage 1) before *not* and *n't*, but no evidence that *not* is produced before *n't*. We did not find support for robust non-anaphoric pre-sentential negation (stage 3) or contracted forms like *don't* and *can't* as unanalyzed wholes (stage 4). The results suggest a great degree of variability in children's productive development (de Villiers \& de Villiers 1979). Our findings are compatible with simultaneous development of frequent negative forms with a production bottleneck that favors shorter utterances like *no* to appear earlier.

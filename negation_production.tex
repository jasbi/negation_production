\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Claim: Children start producing all types of English negation by age 18
months and by 36 months, they produce them at the rate parents do. types
of negation in English: no, sentential (not, nt), lexical (nothing,
nobody, nowhere, none, un-in-de-dis-). For no: higher frequency in
imperatives For sentential negation: \ldots{} For lexical negatoin:
\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  How frequent are different negative forms in children's input?
\item
  What is the developmental trajectory of different negative forms?
\item
  How prevelant are different negative forms in different sentence types
  (imperative, declerative, interrogative)?
\item
  Do lexical negatives develop first or sentential negatives? Could one
  help the other?
\item
  What percentage of children at each age produce negation? different
  forms?
\end{itemize}

Study 2: * What syntactic constructions host negative forms? * How
productive are negative morphemes?

\section{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

Formal and functional development of negation

Participant information: 1. what is the distribution of words per
participant? 2. what proportion of children in each monthly age bin
produce negative morphemes?

Susan's Questions: Are you sure it is a quantifier or a marker of
non-existence? Check the difference between no+N and no-more+N how about
single \enquote{no}s?

To do: 1. cluster the most frequent categories 2. look at the age
distribution for the cluster (what about the distribution of age in
communicative function: nonexistence, nondesire, imperative)

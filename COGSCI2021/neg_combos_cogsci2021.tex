\begin{abstract}
How does negation develop in early child language? Previous work has
hypothesized the concept of negation arises via conmbining negative
morphemes with different communicative functions such as rejection.
However, these specific functions have been challenging to assess given
their abstract concepts. Here we examine the developmental trajectories
of seven communicative functions served by negation in children's
production. Going beyond previous studies that have mainly relied on
manual annotations and small sample sizes, we used large-scale corpora
of child speech in English. We automatically identified each function
based on their distinct syntactic characteristics. Our analyses
demonstrated frequent usage of negation in all seven functions between
the age of 24 - 36 months; yet there are notable differences in
production variability of negation depending on the specifc function
examined.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Negation is an abstract concept crucial to everyday communication. It
can help a coffee shop divide its menu into ``coffee'' and ``not
coffee'' sections, with the ``not coffee'' section bringing together
diverse items with no common label. It can inform us to regulate each
others' actions in a sign like ``no mask, no entry''. It can also
communicate our deepest wants and dislikes, for example when we say ``I
don't like Mondays''. But how does this crucial abstract concept of
negation emerge in the human mind? What are the specific communicative
functions that negation combines with in early language development?

Regarding these two questions, there have been several influential
hypotheses. Starting a century and a half ago, Darwin (1872) thought
that negation has roots in the expression of human emotions and desires.
He hypothesized the earliest manifestation of negation and affirmation
in infants is when they refuse food from parents, by withdrawing their
heads laterally, or when they accept the food, by inclining their heads
forward. He suggested that head shaking and nodding as common gestures
for negation and affirmation have developed from this early habit.
Similarly, many researchers studying early functions of negative
morphemes like \emph{no} proposed that children use them to ``reject''
or ``refuse'' (Bloom, 1970; Choi, 1988; Pea, 1978). For example, when
they are asked ``do you want juice?'', they may say ``no'', ``not want
it'', or ``don't like it''. Pea (1978) proposed this negation function
is the first to emerge in children's early speech.

On the other hand, Bloom (1970) suggested that the use of negation to
expresses ``non-existence'' emerges before rejection or refusal. For
example, when an object that children expect to be present is not
present, children may say: ``no window'', ``no fish in the bathroom'',
or ``I do not have underpants''. Two close concepts to non-existence
discussed in the literature are ``disappearance'' and ``non-occurrence''
(Pea, 1978; Villiers \& Villiers, 1979). Disappearance refers to
situations where an object disappears and children use negation to
express it such as ``no food. all gone'' or ``no more noise''.
Non-occurrence refers to cases when an expected action or event does not
occur as in ``not working'' or ``doggie not barking''. Some researchers
referred to these cases as ``failures'' and included examples like ``no
fit in da box'' or ``it don't fit'' (Cameron-Faulkner, Lieven, \&
Theakston, 2007; Choi, 1988). Non-existence can also be expressed by
negation of locative prepositional phrases (e.g.~``no in there'' or
``daddy was not on the phone''). While rejection was hypothesized to
interact with human emotions and desires, non-existence (broadly
construed to include ``disappearance'' and ``non-occurrence'') likely
interacts with human perception. Choi (1988) proposed that children's
early linguistic negation is used to express both rejection and
non-existence.

Additionally, Choi (1988) introduced ``prohibition'' as one function of
negation and suggested that it emerges as early as rejection and
non-existence. In cases of prohibition, children use linguistic negation
to stop others from performing some action. For example they may say:
``don't go'' or ``do not spill milk''. A special case of prohibition is
``self-prohibition''. For example, a child may approach prohibited food
but immediately say ``no, don't eat'' to stop themselves from doing the
prohibited action.

A function similar to prohibition is ``inability'', in that both involve
conceptualizing actions and negating them, possibly interacting with
early development of motor control. As discussed in Choi (1988),
children tend to communicate their own inability to perform an action
with different negative morphemes (e.g.~\emph{I can't reach} / \emph{I
cannot zip it}). It was suggested that utterances as such emerge after
the first phase (i.e.~non-existence, rejection, prohibition).

Another function of negation discussed in the literature is ``denial''.
Bloom (1970) originally defined it as asserting that ``an actual or
supposed predication was not the case''. For instance a child may say:
``It's not sharp''. Later researchers formulated it as
``truth-functional negation'' and suggested that it is used to negate
the truth of a proposition (Cameron-Faulkner et al., 2007; Pea, 1978).
This definition depends on the assumed logical system and its
assumptions on what type of propositions receive truth values. A
particular sub-function of denial is ``labeling'', which is often
realized as the negation of nominal or adjectival predicates such as
``this is not a bunny'' or ``not red''. These utterances are often used
to introduce new linguistic labels and in turn would possibly facilitate
word learning. Therefore, it is possible that labeling helps the
development of abstract negation.

However, previous research on the origins and functions of negation has
faced two major issues. First, it mainly relied on human annotation and
identification of negative utterances in corpora which is costly and
difficult. As a result, most studies focused on only a handful of
children and a relatively small sample of their speech. This led to the
second caveat, which is that the limited data sizes in previous
experiments possibly influenced their claimed findings. For example,
Nordmeyer \& Frank (2018) looked at the speech of five children in the
Providence corpus (Demuth, Culbertson, \& Alter, 2006) and found a great
deal of individual differences in how early a negative function is
attested. It awaits to be seen whether similar results would hold in
much larger sample sizes.

In this study, we investigate the development of negation in child
speech of English, focusing on the utterance level. To address the
issues raised above, we used of large-scale corpora of child utterances
(MacWhinney, 2000). Specifically, we asked: (1) what communicative
functions are negation combined with and to what extent? (2) within the
same communicative function, does the developmental trajectory differ
depending on particular lexical items that negation modifies
(e.g.~\emph{like} or \emph{want} for rejection)? (3) taking all
functions into account, do they share similar developmental
characteristics, or would there be function-specific differences?

\hypertarget{data-and-preprocessing}{%
\subsection{Data and preprocessing}\label{data-and-preprocessing}}

For developmental data of child language in English, we turned to the
CHILDES database (MacWhinney,
2000).\footnote{Code and data are in quarantine at https://somewhereonearth.}.
We focused on speech produced by children with typical development
within the age range of 12 - 72 months. Negative structures were first
identified based on whether a structure contains any of the three
negative morphemes: \emph{no}, \emph{not} and \emph{n't}. Since the
matters of interest are individual utterances and what negation
\emph{combines} with, cases consisting of one negative morpheme were
excluded (e.g.~\emph{no}!). Preprocessing led to a data set of 365,260
negative utterances from a total of 811 children across 56 corpora.

\hypertarget{negation-functions}{%
\subsection{Negation functions}\label{negation-functions}}

Besides the communicative function of rejection, non-existence,
prohibition, inability and denial (labeling), we expanded with two other
functions: epistemic negation (Choi, 1988) and possession (see Table 1).
For each function, we first characterized the syntactic features of the
linguistic structures that the negative morphemes are combined with.
Then negative utterances of different communicative functions were
automatically extracted in a rule-based fashion, i.e.~based on the
syntactic characteristics. In order to do this, we resorted to the
available morphosyntactic information provided from CHILDES (Sagae,
Davis, Lavie, MacWhinney, \& Wintner, 2010), such as part-of-speech
(POS) tags as well as grammatical or syntactic dependency relations.
After extracting negative utterances, the developmental trajectories of
different constructions of interest were analyzed.

In what follows we introduce each construction and present the results.
While our focus is child utterances, we used parents' speech as
references and therefore our plots often contrast the relative frequency
(or ratio) of these constructions between children's and parents'
production at the corresponding age of the child.

\hypertarget{rejection}{%
\subsubsection{Rejection}\label{rejection}}

For the function of rejection, we examined cases where the lemma of the
head verb of the phrase is either \emph{like} or \emph{want}, and the
head verb is modified by one of the three negative morphemes. Each of
the utterances either takes a subject or has no subject at all. And the
existence of a subject was determined via searching for a word in the
utterance that has the \emph{SUBJ} dependency relation with the head
verb.

Additionally, other than expressions that the speaker used to describe
their own emotion (e.g.~(1)) or their (in)ability to do so (e.g.~(2)),
we also included cases that express rhetorical inquiries of emotions
from one interlocutor addressed to another (e.g.~(3)) as well as
instances where the speaker is describing the emotion of somebody else
(e.g.~(4)). Overall our data extraction resulted in a total of 21,034
utterances (Child: 9,608; Parent: 11,426).

~ (1) \emph{I no like sea} / \emph{don't wanna go}

~ (2) \emph{I can't like that}

~ (3) \emph{don't you wanna try it}

~ (4) \emph{Sarah doesn't like that either}

To compare the patterns between child and parent speech, we measured the
following four metrics. The first one is the relative ratio of each of
the three negative morphemes overall. For instance, given the 9,608
utterances from child speech that serve as rejections, there are 8,531
cases with the negative morpheme \emph{no}; then the ratio of these
utterances was calculated as 8,531 / 9,608 = 0.41. The second one is the
relative ratio of negative morphemes within different head verbs
(e.g.~\emph{like} vs.~\emph{want} for rejection). For example, again
with child speech that express rejections, utterances where the negative
morphemes modify the head verb \emph{like} occur for 3,268 times; then
the ratio of these cases was computed as 3,268 / 9,608 = 0.16. The third
one is the relative ratio of the negative utterances at different ages
of the child. For instance, for rejection, at the age of 36 months, the
total number of instances with the negative morphemes in child speech is
888; then their ratio was calculated as 888 / 9,608 = 0.04.

The last one is the amount of variability in the production of the
specific function across the age span of the child, which was measured
with entropy (Cover \& Thomas, 1991). For example, after computing the
relative ratio \emph{P(x\_i)} of the negative utterances at a number of
\(N\) ages of the child for the specific function, the production
variability is calculated using the equation below. \begin{equation}
H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^N P(x_i)log_2P(x_i) 
\end{equation}

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{figs/emotion-1}

\caption[Rejection]{Rejection}\label{fig:emotion}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

In both child and parent speech, when articulating desires or emotions
with either of the two head verbs \emph{like} and \emph{want}, the most
frequently used negative morpheme is \emph{n't} combined with an
auxiliary verb. Comparing the two different head verbs, overall the
negative morphemes co-occur with \emph{want} more frequently. With that
being said, the amount of variability in both child and parent
production is similar, a pattern that holds for both head verbs (Child
\emph{like}: 0.12; Child \emph{want} 0.12; Parent \emph{like}: 0.12;
Parent \emph{want}: 0.12).

On the other hand, when looking at the developmental trajectory, as
presented in Figure 1, children's usage of negative morphemes is
comparable regardless of the particular head verb. In general, children
start applying the negative morphemes for the function of rejection more
regularly around the age of 22 months. Within the context of the corpus
data that we analyzed, their usage of these morphemes is the most
frequent during the age range of 25 - 36 months.

\hypertarget{non-existence}{%
\subsubsection{Non-existence}\label{non-existence}}

For the function of non-existence, we extracted utterances that either
have expletives marked by \emph{there} (e.g.~(5)), or cases where the
negative morphemes are modifying a nominal (i.e.~its syntactic head
based on the CHILDES annotation is a nominal; e.g.~(6)). With utterances
such as (6) in particular, in order to not confuse with the function of
labeling (see below), we did not include any cases where the syntactic
head of the negative morphemes is a predicate of a copula verb
(e.g.~\emph{this is not candy}). This led to a total of 34,672
utterances (Child: 16,866; Parent: 17,806).

~ (5) \emph{there's no water}

~ (6) \emph{no (more) candy} / \emph{not your mouth}

In both child and parent speech, the most frequently occurred negative
morphemes to indicate non-existence is \emph{no}. The amount of
production variability approximates 0.12 regardless of the specific
speaker. As shown in Figure 2, children began increasing their use of
the negative morphemes to express non-existence around the age of 22
months, which is similar to that for the function of rejection and in
opposition to what was initially proposed by Bloom (1970).

}

\caption[Non-existence]{Non-existence}\label{fig:existence}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{prohibition}{%
\subsubsection{Prohibition}\label{prohibition}}

For utterances that articulate the function of prohibition, we focused
on cases where the negative morphemes are combined with the auxiliary
verb \emph{do} (\emph{do}, \emph{does}, \emph{did}) and the auxiliary
does not take any subject (e.g.~(7)). In certain cases the negative
morphemes and the auxiliary together modifies a head verb. For instances
as such, in order to not overlap with rejection, non-existence and
epistemic negation and possession (see below), our search excluded cases
where the head verb has any of the following lemma forms: \emph{like},
\emph{want}, \emph{know}, \emph{think}, \emph{remember}, \emph{have}.
This resulted in a total of 21,197 utterances (Child: 6,140; Parent:
15,057).

After applying our metrics, overall the most frequently used negative
morpheme is \emph{n't} when articulating prohibition. The amount of
production variability for this function is comparable in both child and
parent speech, with an approximate value of 0.12. Based on Figure 3,
children started more regular usage of negative morphemes to articulate
prohibition around the age of 23 months. This finding also corresponds
to the proposal from (Choi, 1988), which suggested that prohibition
emerges around similar times compared to rejection and non-existence.

~ (7) \emph{don't blame Charlotte} / \emph{don't}

}

\caption[Inability]{Inability}\label{fig:inability}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{inability}{%
\subsubsection{Inability}\label{inability}}

We analyzed instances where the negative morphemes co-occur with the
auxiliary \emph{can} (\emph{can} and \emph{could}; e.g.~(8)) for the
function of inability. Again, for instances with a head verb modified by
the negative morphemes and the auxiliary, we filtered out cases where
the head verbs are the focus for other functions. Cases that do not have
a subject (e.g.~\emph{can't play}) or do not contain a subject other
than I (e.g.~\emph{you can't do that}) could yield ambiguous readings
without taking a larger discourse context into account; they could be a
rhetorical question or also express the concept of prohibition.
Therefore to avoid potential ambiguity, we restricted our analyses only
to cases with a subject \emph{I}. This led to a subset of 9,150
utterances (Child: 5,410; Parent: 3,740).

~ (8) \emph{I can't see} / \emph{I can't}

Comparing child and parent production, the negative morpheme that is
used most frequently is also \emph{n't}. As shown in Figure 4, the
developmental trajectory of this function is similar to that for
prohibition (Choi, 1988), and the negative morphemes are applied more
regularly starting around the age of 23 months. The amount of production
variability in both child and parent speech is approximately 0.12.

\hypertarget{labeling}{%
\subsubsection{Labeling}\label{labeling}}

To capture the function of denials, in parituclar the instances of
labeling, we concentrated on cases where negative morphemes are adopted
to indicate the identity (e.g.~(9)), and/or characteristics (e.g.~(10))
of a predicative nominal. In addition, we also included instances where
the negative morphemes are used to modify a predicative adjective
(e.g.~(11)). Following these criteria, utterances where the negative
morpheme is modifying a nominal or adjectival predicate of a copula verb
were extracted. None of the utterances contained expletives (\emph{there
is no book}). The existence of a predicate was identified with the help
of POS information and dependency relation. The POS of the predicate has
to be either noun (\emph{n}) or adjective (\emph{adj}), and its
dependency relation with the copula has to be \emph{PRED}. This resulted
in a total of 20,329 utterances (Child: 4,793; Parent: 15,536).

~ (9) \emph{that's not a farmer}

~ (10) \emph{I'm not a heavy baby Mum}

~ (11) \emph{It's no good}

Comparing the three negative morphemes, the most frequently used is
\emph{not} regardless of the specific speaker, and the amount of
production variability is comparable (\textasciitilde0.12) between child
and parent speech. Based on results from Figure 5, the developmental
trajectory of using the negative morphemes in the domain of language
learning is comparable to previous domains. Children started using the
negative morphemes for the function of labeling more frequently around
the age of 24 months.

\end{CodeChunk}

\hypertarget{epistemic-negation}{%
\subsubsection{Epistemic Negation}\label{epistemic-negation}}

The function of epistemic negation was originally discussed by Choi
(1988). Although there has been no proposal for negation originating in
children's understanding of their own or others' epistemic/mental
states, previous studies have reported many instances where the negative
morphemes are combined with mental state verbs such as \emph{know},
\emph{think}, and \emph{remember}. Here we focused on these three verbs
and analyzed utterances that articulate the concept of unknowing
(e.g.~(12)) or uncertainty (e.g.~(13)). The verbs in these cases are
modified by the negative morphemes or the combination of negation with
auxiliaries. By these search criteria, instances where the speaker
inquires about or describes the negative epistemic state of another
speaker (e.g.~(14)) were also selected. This led to a subset of 32,793
utterances in total (Child: 10,389; Parent: 22,404).

~ (12) \emph{I not know} / \emph{I didn't remember}

~ (13) \emph{I don't think so}

~ (14) \emph{don't you remember} / \emph{She doesn't know this}

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{figs/epistemic-1} 

}

\caption[Epistemic]{Epistemic}\label{fig:epistemic}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

In both child and parent speech, the most frequently used negative
morpheme that modifies epistemic state is \emph{n't}, a pattern that is
consistent across the three different head verbs. And the negative
morphemes tend to co-occur more often in cases that describe the state
of unknowing, which is indicated mainly by the verb \emph{know}. Based
on results from Figure 6, the production of \emph{know} for expressions
of epistemic state starts earlier in comparison to \emph{remember} and
\emph{think}. On the other hand, the production variability for each of
the head verb (\textasciitilde0.12) is comparable to each other
regardless of the particular speaker. Overall, children began to apply
the negative morphemes to articulate this function in a more regular
fashion around the age of 25 months.

\hypertarget{possession}{%
\subsubsection{Possession}\label{possession}}

The last function that we investigated includes utterances that are
combined with negative morphemes to denote possession. Specifically, we
selected cases where the negative morphemes are modifying a possessive
pronoun (e.g.~(15)), as well as instances where the negative morphemes
are combined with auxiliary verbs to modify a head verb with the lemma
form \emph{have} (e.g.~(16)). Again similarly to our search for
utterances that express non-existence, we excluded cases in which the
syntactic head of the negative morphemes is a predicate of a copula verb
(e.g.~\emph{this is not mine}). The number of utterances that were
subjected to analysis for this function is 9,265 (Child: 2,899; Parent:
6,366). The developmental trajectory for this function, as shown in
Figure 7, is comparable to the other functions, where children started
to combine negative morphemes around the age of 22 months.

~ (15) \emph{not mine}

~ (16) \emph{I don't have it}

\end{figure*}

Figure 8 shows the developmental trajectory for all analyzed negative
functions. The y-axis is the relative frequency of each construction
relative to the frequency of all constructions within a monthly age
period. Children's negative utterances bear considerable resemblance to
parent speech in terms of the overall production frequency. Early on,
the most frequently applied function is non-existence, while the
functions with relatively smaller number of occurrences include
possession and inability. With that being said, there are a number of
observable differences with respects to the production variability of
individual function. Comparing across functions, the usage of negative
morphemes for non-existence is the most variable or the least
consistent, with there being more variability in child speech than
parent speech (Child: 1.61; Parent: 1.08). On the other hand, the
opposite patterns are observed for prohibitions (Child: 0.62; Parent:
0.92) and labeling (Child: 0.49; Parent: 0.94).

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Previous research on the development of negation have used
human-annotated small-scale corpora to study early communicative
functions of negation in children's speech. By contrast, this study
presented an automatic and large-scale approach using POS and syntactic
dependency relations to define and extract relevant structures. In
particular, we presented analyses on utterances combined with negation
to convey rejection, non-existence, prohibition, inability, labeling,
epistemic states and possession. Overall our results provided evidence
that negation is frequently combined with all these functions between
the age of 24 to 36 months, and that there are quantifiable differences
in the production variability of the negative morphemes depending on the
specific function.

One important limitation of our approach is that we have used data from
children's production to assess the development of negation as a
concept. While it is possible that patterns in children's production
reflect their comprehension and semantic development as well, this is
not guaranteed. Most importantly, there are production-specific effects
(e.g.~length of utterance, ease of pronunciation) that we have not taken
into account yet. Thus, results from production data alone do not
suffice to conclude that early development of negation is necessarily
conceptual. Further experiments testing children's comprehension of
negative utterances that serve different communicative functions are
necessary in order to understand the origin of negation more thoroughly.

In future work, we plan to investigate the production trajectory of
positive counterparts to our negative structures (e.g.~\emph{I don't
know} vs.~\emph{I know}). We intend to also apply our analyses to
individual children in order to assess individual differences. Lastly,
our experiments thus far have concentrated on multi-word syntactic
structures at the utterance level, therefore cases where negations are
used as discourse markers in single-word or few-word expressions were
excluded. However, discourse markers as responses to a previous
utterance(s) have important semantic and conceptual roles in the
communication between children and parents (e.g.~Parent: \emph{do you
want some bread?}; Child: \emph{no no no}). Inclusions of negative
structures at the discourse level, along with more carefully manual
inspections, would allow us to paint a more clear picture about the
development of negation.
